# noizee-vue3

An port of [Noizee](https://github.com/pedroCX486/noizee) to Vue3. Not a complete port (doesn't have the universal mute button or CKEditor, I couldn't bother with that). Tried using the best practices for an application as simple as this.

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```
