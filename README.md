# Noizee (Vue3 + TS + Vite Port)

An port of [Noizee](https://github.com/pedroCX486/noizee) to Vue3, which itself was an opensource alternative to Noisli.

Simply use `yarn install`, also recommended is to use Volar with Takeover Mode instead of Vetur.

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production (targetting the /noizee/ subfolder)
```
yarn build
```
